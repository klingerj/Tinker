# Tinker Engine

My second game engine project. Made with things learned from Handmade Hero, coworkers, and lessons learned from the older [Joe Engine](https://github.com/klingerj/Joe-Engine). Nearly everything written from scratch, extremely minimal libraries/dependencies. Tinker has superior software architecture, minimal dependencies, compiles faster, and has other debatably cooler features and capabilities than the Joe Engine.

Currently, the project renders a few instanced models with a Z prepass (fairly barebones graphics-wise):

Output from the SPIR-V virtual machine, evaluating a very simple Lambertian shader:

<!--- Early in the project, I added very simple software raytracing to try to match the hardware rasterized output of the game:

### Build instructions
You will need to have installed:
* Visual Studio 2019, because the project will currently check for  
<code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Professional\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvarsall.bat</code>  
(<code>Community</code> and <code>Enterprise</code> versions will also work)
* Vulkan SDK version 1.3.216.0 or higher from [LunarG](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home#windows)

To Build:
* Run <code>proj_shell.bat</code> in the <code>Scripts/</code> directory. You can do this by double-clicking in the file explorer or from command line.
* In that shell window, run <code>ez-build_release.bat</code>. This will build every Tinker project.
You should now be able to run the game via <code>run_game.bat</code>.  
You can find more detailed info on the various build projects [here](Scripts/README.md).

### Dependencies
* [DirectXShaderCompiler (DXC)](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler)
