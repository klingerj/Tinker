# Tinker Engine

My second game engine project. Made with things learned from Handmade Hero, coworkers, and lessons learned from the older [Joe Engine](https://github.com/klingerj/Joe-Engine). Nearly everything written from scratch, extremely minimal libraries/dependencies. Tinker has superior software architecture, minimal dependencies, compiles faster, and has other debatably cooler features and capabilities than the Joe Engine.

Currently, the project renders a few instanced models with a Z prepass (fairly barebones graphics-wise):

Output from the SPIR-V virtual machine, evaluating a very simple Lambertian shader:

Early in the project, I added very simple software raytracing to try to match the hardware rasterized output of the game: 
Raytraced | Rasterized

### Project hierarchy description
* <code>Assets/</code> - art files to load
* <code>Benchmark/</code> - simple setup for running benchmarked code
* <code>Core/</code> - all engine and platform code
  * <code>DataStructures/</code> - data structures, e.g. vector and hashmap
  * <code>Graphics/</code> - graphics api layer as well as backends, e.g. Vulkan
  * <code>Math/</code> - math ops, e.g. matrix multiply (SIMD-accelerated)
  * <code>Platform/</code> - platform/threading api layer as well as application main, e.g. Windows
  * <code>Raytracing/</code> - (WIP, not done!) minimal raytracing and octree code
  * <code>Utility/</code> - logging, mem alloc tracking, code block timing
* <code>Game/</code> - all game code, builds as dll
* <code>Output/</code> - dumping ground for output files, e.g. raytraced image
* <code>SPIR-V-VM/</code> - (WIP, not done!) virtual machine for evaluating SPIR-V shaders, written in pure C
* <code>Scripts/</code> - build scripts and some helpful project scripts
* <code>Shaders/</code>
  * <code>hlsl/</code> - shader source code

* <code>Test/</code> - simple setup for running unit tests
* <code>ThirdParty/</code> - external libraries (kept minimal)
* <code>Tools/</code> - code for separate tools
  * <code>ShaderCompiler/</code> - code that calls into DXC to compile HLSL shaders to SPIR-V (eventually DXIL too) 
* <code>ToolsBin/</code> - built binaries of code from <code>Tools/</code>

### Build instructions
You will need to have installed:
* Visual Studio 2019, because the project will currently check for  
<code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Professional\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvarsall.bat</code>  
(<code>Community</code> and <code>Enterprise</code> versions will also work)
* Vulkan SDK version 1.3.216.0 or higher from [LunarG](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home#windows)

To Build:
* Run <code>proj_shell.bat</code> in the <code>Scripts/</code> directory. You can do this by double-clicking in the file explorer or from command line.
* In that shell window, run <code>ez-build_release.bat</code>. This will build every Tinker project.
You should now be able to run the game via <code>run_game.bat</code>.

### Game Demo Controls:
<code>Esc</code> - lock/unlock cursor  
<code>WASD</code> - move camera  
<code>Mouse</code> - look around  

### Platforms supported currently:
* Windows 10 / x86

### Graphics API backends supported currently:
* Vulkan
